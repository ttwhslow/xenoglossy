    <h1>Whiplash</h1>
    One look, give 'em whiplash
Beat drop with a big flash
Coming hot, better think fast
This look is a must have, uh
When you see it, know I did that, uh
Day one, know I been bad, uh
Don't stop, better press gas
Going hammer, can't touch that (can't touch that)
    <h2>Whip-whiplash, whip-whiplash</h2>
    Fancy
This is opulence, it's glowing and it's flashy (yeah)
Never one to do too much, I keep it classy
I'm not the one, the two or three
So don't you ask me (yeah)
Feel free to gas me, yeah
